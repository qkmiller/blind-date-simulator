        <p>Your date is confused by your lack of action and tries to put out the flames, but it's too late. The table is completely engulfed. While the fire spreads to another table and part of the wall, panic spreads amongst other customers and staff. Everyone evacuates, the entire first floor is engulfed, and the fire department is desparately trying to contain the blaze. It's safe to say that the night is ruined, and you never get a reply from from your date in the following days.</p>
